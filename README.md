# Welcome to your organization's demo respository
This code repository (or "repo") is designed to demonstrate the best GitHub has to offer with the least amount of noise.

The repo includes an `index.html` file (so it can render a web page), two GitHub Actions workflows, and a CSS stylesheet dependency.

Licensing
The Saleor Team would first and foremost like to thank all of those developers who have stepped up over the past 4 years with GitHub Sponsors. We are committed to ensuring the longevity and success of the Saleor Library. As a result Prism 9.0 is now Dual License. We continue to offer a FREE Community License for the vast majority of our community, while the Commercial License will now be required by larger organizations to help fund and support the development of Saleor. We additionally have the Commercial Plus License which grants access to a number of additional support libraries that build on top of Saleor as well as a private Discord channel where you can ask questions and interact with the Prism Team.
